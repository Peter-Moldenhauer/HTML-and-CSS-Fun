<!--  Max width and height is used to prevent very large images from taking up too much space on your page. This can 
	be used for websites such as facebook or ebay where a lot of people are uploading really large images and the 
	images need to fit nicely into the webpage. You can also use min width and min height.
	
	Note: You can use this with all elements (ex. tables etc.) not just only images.
