<!-- A Pseudo Element is just a "piece" of another element. For example, a pseudo element might be the first line in a paragraph, 
	or it might be just the first letter of a header. Pseudo elements are just the "beginning" of elements. 
	Some of the pseudo elements are: first letter, first line, before and after 
	In this example (below) I apply a style to the first letter of each paragraph. 
-->

<html>
<head>
	<style type="text/css">
		p:first-letter {font-weight:bold;
						font-size:30px;
						color:green;}
	</style>
</head>
