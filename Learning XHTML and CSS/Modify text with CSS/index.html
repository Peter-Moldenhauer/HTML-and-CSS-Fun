<!-- To use CSS you need to first use style tags in the head and you need to make the type="text/css"
	For the styles themselves, you need 1) SELECTOR - which is the specific HTML element that you want to change
	(in this example the selector is p) 2) PROPERTY - what do you want to change about the selector/element (in this 
	example, color and font-family are properties) 3) VALUE - what do you want to change the property to (i.e. what 
	color or what font-family) 
-->

<html>

			font-family:arial;
		}
	</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>this is paragraph text modified by CSS</p>
